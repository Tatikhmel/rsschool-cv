        <h1>Career objective and the candidate information</h1>
        <p>Looking to obtain a position in the IT industry where my international educational and working experience will allow to
        make an immediate contribution to the company development.</p>
        <p>My career journey started with English-Chinese-Russian written and oral translations. Working as an interpreter I had to
        provide high interpretation service in Russian, English and Chinese spoken by foreign students and Russian teachers.
        Beside that I have a wide-range experience of teaching foreign languages and I have already translated 3 books into Chinese and many articles related to different subjects. All this experience allowed me to develop the necessary <span>SOFT
        SKILLS</span> that can also relate to Frontend development:
        <ul>
            <li>great language and communication skills;</li>
            <li>ability to work in team and alone;</li>
            <li>conduct research each time starting a translation on a new/unknown topic;</li>
            <li>diligently work on any task;</li>
            <li>ability to explain complicated things in a simple way;</li>
            <li>organize the workflow;</li>
            <li>prioritize tasks;</li>
            <li>in case of coming across any difficulties, I'm able to independently make research and find suitable solutions and
        only if it is impossible to solve the problem on my own, seek to colleagues for help etc.</li>
        </ul>
